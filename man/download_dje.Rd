\section{About DJEs}{

Electronic Court Records are documents published almost
daily by every state's Justice Court containing important information
regarding new lawsuits being filed, decisions being made by judges,
and so on. Note that DJEs may be split into multiple "booklets"; when
this happens it means that each booklet contains information about
only one type of lawsuit.
